# üß≥ EasyVisa ‚Äî Visa Approval Prediction Project

## üìÑ Project Overview
**EasyVisa** is a data-driven solution designed for the **Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC)** in the United States to assist in visa application processing.  
With the rapid increase in visa applications each year, manually reviewing and shortlisting candidates for certification has become tedious and time-consuming.  
This project leverages **Machine Learning** to predict visa approval outcomes and identify the key drivers influencing visa certification decisions.

## üéØ Objective
To develop a classification model that can:
- Facilitate the process of visa approvals.
- Identify and recommend applicants who have higher chances of **visa certification**.
- Discover the factors that significantly influence the **case status** (Certified or Denied).

## üîç Insights Summary
- **Full-time positions** and **higher prevailing wages** showed a strong positive correlation with visa certification.  
- Applicants with **relevant job experience** and **higher education levels** were more likely to be certified.  
- Companies with **more years of establishment** and **larger employee counts** had a higher success rate in certifications.  
- **Unit of wage** and **region of employment** also had noticeable influence on visa outcomes.
